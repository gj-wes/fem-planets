# Frontend Mentor - Planets fact site solution

This is a solution to the [Planets fact site challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/planets-fact-site-gazqN8w_f).

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each planet page and toggle between "Overview", "Internal Structure", and "Surface Geology"

## My process

### Built with

- Nuxt
- Tailwind

### Extras

- Added some minor animations and transitions
- Added a planet list on index view, mainly to try out scroll-snapping
